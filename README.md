## Welcome to Rakki's bot!
Does some useful stuff for me potentially \\
```// Dont include `[]` for the commands that take an input``` <br>
## Diary  : 

*The Diary portion of this bot is to help make diary entrees more neat, and in the future hopefully add some features to improve them. <br>

`r!e [subject]` - Creates a entree with todays date and with the subject entered 

## Calorant

Calorant is a game tracker inspired and named by Julia (unintentionally)

everything Calorant related begins with r!c (subject to change in the future however)

`r!c new` - adds you to the system
`r!c w` - adds one win to your account  
`r!c l` - adds one loss to your account  
`r!c s` - gives you a summary of your net wins and loss for the day, week, and month. 
`r!c channel` - At the end of each period you'll be sent your totals for that period. type this in the channel you would like to be sent it at. (however trying to set this as DM crashes the bot)
`r!c w:[win Count] l:[Loss Count]` - lets you add a big number of wins and losses to your profile at once. 
Ex. `r!c w:32 l:70` adds 32 wins and 70 losses to your account.
